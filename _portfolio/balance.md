## My Contributions

I was part of the original team that launched Balance in 2019 and contributed in different aspects as Director of Product Engineering. Here's a brief overview of my contributions to the project:
- Designed an interactive framework and tooling to standardize the creation of 100+ meditation experiences (Lua, C++, Swift, Python).
- Designed an asset versioning and delivery system (Python, Swift, AWS).
- Developed an A/B testing framework from scratch (Ruby/Rails, SQL, LookML), including variant assignment and significance analysis.
