## My Contributions

The PuzzlePal app was born as a partnership between [Elevate Labs](https://elevateapp.com/about) and [Keesing MG](https://www.keesing.com). I was tasked with a very interesting role: developing the initial pitch for the app into a project outline, including scope, team, budget and timeline. After that initial stage, I led both the technical and product management aspects of the project from start to delivery.

After the project was handed off to Keesing MG, I was hired as a consultant to help them continue development of the project with their in-house team. The app was launched in 2021 and has continued to grow since then. Here's a brief overview of my contributions to the project:

On the technical side:
- Set up CI system for unit testing and deployment (TeamCity, fastlane).
- Built an OpenGL-based macOS app as an internal tool to run and develop games (Obj-C, C++), which greatly increased development speed and productivity.
- Integrated Sign in with Apple and Anonymous Signup, resulting in 50% -> 95% signup rates (Obj-C, Ruby/Rails).
- Designed and built the Achievements feature (Obj-C, C++, Lua).

On the management side:
- Developed product roadmap, structured team, and established development processes.
- Hired 2 new team members, from recruitment to interviewing & onboarding.
- Owned product management & technical leadership.
