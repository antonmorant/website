Hi! I'm Ant√≥n, a San Francisco-based software engineer with a passion for solving problems and building cool stuff. During the last 12 years in the industry I have worked on different technical areas including mobile development, backend, databases, data engineering & analytics, people management & product management.

Some highlights of my previous experience includes working on and shipping mobile applications such as Elevate, Balance and PuzzlePal, which have won several awards including Apple's App of the Year. If you're interested in learning more about my past projects, please check out my [portfolio]({{ "/portfolio" | relative_url }}).

During the last 2+ years working as a consultant, I have had the chance to help my clients achieve various goals by putting my skills and experience at their service. I have been told that some of my strengths include an analytical mindset, attention to detail, reliability and communication skills. In particular, I have been praised for being able to successfully bridge the gap between engineering and non-engineering teams, which has been key for driving projects from inception to completion to everybody's satisfaction.

When I'm not working, you'll often find me outdoors enjoying nature, grabbing coffee with a friend, practicing martial arts, or at home playing games. I strongly believe in leading a balanced life: cultivating happiness and productivity both in and outside of work creates a positive feedback loop leading to greater success in both.

If this sounds like somebody who could help your team or organization push forward with its goals, I'd love to hear from you. Feel free to reach out to me via <mailto:{{ site.email }}> to find out if I can be of help. Thanks for stopping by!
